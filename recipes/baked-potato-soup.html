        <p>Russet potatoes are perfect for this baked potato soup, as they'll break down beautifully during the cooking process. You can use Yukon Golds, but you might have to cook the soup a bit longer. </p>

        <p> We don't recommend freezing baked potato soup. The cream and potatoes will become grainy and watering as they thaw, so you should try to enjoy this soup within five days. </p>
